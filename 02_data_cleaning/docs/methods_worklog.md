# Data Cleaning Methods Worklog

This document is the central operational log for the data cleaning workflow.
It records what was done, what is currently being done, and what is planned next.

## Why this file exists

Use this as the main chronological source for your thesis Methods section.
It complements (does not replace) the decision-focused log in [cleaning_decisions.md](cleaning_decisions.md).

- methods_worklog.md: timeline of actions, scripts, scope, outputs, and checks.
- cleaning_decisions.md: methodological justifications for non-trivial decisions.

## Update rules

For each relevant step, record:
- date,
- status (done/in-progress/planned),
- objective,
- exact script/notebook used,
- input and output locations,
- validation evidence,
- link to a decision ID when applicable.

Keep entries short and factual.

## Copilot Update Protocol

Use this protocol in any chat session for this repository.

- At the start of a new request, state whether the action should be logged in this worklog.
- After each completed data-cleaning action, append one row to the Methods Timeline table.
- If a step changes methodology or assumptions, also add or reference an entry in cleaning_decisions.md.
- Before ending the session, confirm which Step ID(s) were added.

Quick reminder phrase you can paste in any chat:

"Please execute the task and then update 02_data_cleaning/docs/methods_worklog.md with a new Step ID row before you finish."
